 * 
 *     T(S1,a,S2)=0.2
 *     T(S1,a,S3)=0.8
 * 
 * An object StateActionTransModel would represent this information, corresponding

 * 
 *     reachableStates = [S2, S3]
 *     probs = [0.2, 0.8]
 * 
 * Notice that the whole transition model is composed by a set of instances of
 * this class, one for each pair state-action. In this example case, we could 
 * have something like:
 * 
 * StateActionTransModel S1_a = new StateActionTransModel(reachableStates, probs);
